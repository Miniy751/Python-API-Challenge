## Analysis##

The three analysis that can be drawn from the  WeatherPy.ipynb file are:
1)	As seen in the plots the temperature  becomes warmer as we approach the equator â€“ indicating that temperature is affected by latitude.

2)	 There is a weak relationship between latitude and cloudiness.


3)	In both the north and south hemisphere, there is a weak correlation between deviating from the equator and an increase in humidity.
